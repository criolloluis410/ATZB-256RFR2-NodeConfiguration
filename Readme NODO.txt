Readme NODE 

The repository contains all the files to edit the source code and run it. The coding of the algorithm has been made to run on the ATZB256RFR2 node
Once the Atmel Sudio 7 IDE is installed, when you run the file NODO_NORMAL.atsln, all the files in the NODO-NORMAL folder that are part of the project are available. This way you can access and modify the coding.

In the NODE_NORMAL folder is the SRC folder in which are the files that contain the algorithm code for the node to function as a sensor node.

When you run the NODO_CONTROLER.atsln file, the project is opened in the Atmel Sudio 7 IDE. This way you have access to all the information stored in the NODO-CONTROLER folder.

In the NODO_CONTROLER folder is the SRC folder in which are the files that contain the coding of the algorithm for the node to function as a controller node.
